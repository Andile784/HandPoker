To implement the Poker Hand Evaluator, we will build a command-line tool in Python language that will take the user's input, evaluate it, and return the result. The program will use an algorithm to classify the five cards based on their rank, suit, and frequency, and then compare them against the predefined poker hands to determine the highest possible hand.

The following are the steps that our Poker Hand Evaluator program will follow:

Get the input from the user: The user will input the five cards as a string, where each card is represented by two characters. The first character represents the rank, and the second character represents the suit. For example, "AS" represents the Ace of Spades, and "3H" represents the 3 of Hearts.

Parse the input: We will parse the user input and convert it into a format that is easier to work with. We will store each card as a tuple with two elements: rank and suit. The rank will be represented as an integer from 2 to 14, where 11 represents Jack, 12 represents Queen, 13 represents King, and 14 represents Ace. The suit will be represented as a string: "C" for Clubs, "D" for Diamonds, "H" for Hearts, and "S" for Spades.

Sort the cards: We will sort the cards based on their rank, from lowest to highest.

Evaluate the hand: We will evaluate the hand by comparing the cards against the predefined poker hands. We will start with the highest ranking hand and work our way down. If the hand matches the criteria for a particular poker hand, we will return that hand as the result.

Handle errors: We will handle any errors gracefully, such as invalid input or unexpected behavior.

To make the program extensible and maintainable, we will use modular design patterns and write unit tests to ensure that the program behaves as expected. We will also provide clear documentation and comments to explain the logic and reasoning behind our code

By using classes, we have encapsulated the data and the logic into separate units, which makes the code easier to read, understand, and maintain. We can also easily extend the program by adding new methods or attributes to the classes. For example, we can add a eq method to the Card class to compare cards, or a lt method to sort cards by suit. We can also subclass the Hand class to create different types of poker hands, such as a Texas Hold'em hand or a Omaha hand, with their own rules and evaluations.
