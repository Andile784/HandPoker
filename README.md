Prioritizing features:

The highest priority is to implement a function that can correctly evaluate a given poker hand and return the highest rank that can be obtained using those 5 cards.
The second priority is to create a user-friendly interface, either through a command-line interface or a web application, that allows users to input their hand and receive an answer indicating the rank of their hand.
The third priority is to ensure that the code is easily maintainable and extensible, so that other developers can easily modify or extend the code as needed.

Code structure:

To ensure that the code is maintainable and extensible, I have decided to use object-oriented programming (OOP) and design principles such as separation of concerns and the single responsibility principle.
I have also separated the code into different modules to make it more organized and easier to work with.
Additionally, I have used docstrings and comments throughout the code to make it more readable and easier to understand.

Testing methodologies:

I have included a basic example of how to test the program using the unittest framework in Python.
The tests cover several different poker hands and their expected rankings, and can be run to ensure that the program is functioning correctly.

Git history:

I have included a Git commit history with the code, which shows the progression of the code over time as I worked on it.
This provides a record of the changes made to the code and how it was developed over time, which can be helpful for future developers who may need to modify or extend the code.

Instructions for running the code:

The code is written in Python 3, and can be run on any system that has Python 3 installed.
To run the program, simply run the main.py file using the Python interpreter.
You can also run the tests by running the test.py file using the unittest framework in Python.
